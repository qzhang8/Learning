We can think of attention as performing fuzzy lookup in a key-value store.
In a lookup table, we have a table of keys that map to values. The query matches one of the keys, returning its value.
In attention, the query matches all keys softly, to a weight between 0 and 1. The keysâ€™ values are multiplied by the weights and summed.
