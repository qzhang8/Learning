// RenderView corresponds to the content container of a renderer's subset
// of the frame tree. A frame tree that spans multiple renderers will have a
// RenderView in each renderer, containing the local frames that belong to
// that renderer. The RenderView holds non-frame-related state that is
// replicated across all renderers, and is a fairly shallow object.
// Generally, most APIs care about state related to the page content which
// should be accessed through RenderFrame instead.
//
// WARNING: Historically RenderView was the path to get to the main frame,
// and the entire frame tree, but that is no longer the case. Usually
// RenderFrame is a more appropriate surface for new code, unless the code is
// agnostic of frames and page content or structure. For more context, please
// see https://crbug.com/467770 and
// https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/site-isolation.

// RenderFrame interface wraps functionality, which is specific to frames, such as
// navigation. It provides communication with a corresponding RenderFrameHost
// in the browser process.


// WebContents is the core class in content/. A WebContents renders web content
// (usually HTML) in a rectangular area.
//
// Instantiating one is simple:
//   std::unique_ptr<content::WebContents> web_contents(
//       content::WebContents::Create(
//           content::WebContents::CreateParams(browser_context)));
//   gfx::NativeView view = web_contents->GetNativeView();
//   // |view| is an HWND, NSView*, etc.; insert it into the view hierarchy
//   // wherever it needs to go.
//
// That's it; go to your kitchen, grab a scone, and chill. WebContents will do
// all the multi-process stuff behind the scenes. More details are at
// https://www.chromium.org/developers/design-documents/multi-process-architecture
// .
//
// Each WebContents has exactly one NavigationController; each
// NavigationController belongs to one WebContents. The NavigationController can
// be obtained from GetController(), and is used to load URLs into the
// WebContents, navigate it backwards/forwards, etc. See navigation_controller.h
// for more details.
